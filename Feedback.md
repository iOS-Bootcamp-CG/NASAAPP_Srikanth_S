1. Clear the previous image when new date is selected. As of now, it shows old image for a fraction of seconds
2. I can add duplicate entries in FAV. Try to use a primary key to avoid duplicate entries in FAV listing
3. Once APOD is added to FAV, there is no way the user would know. You should make the heart icon colored for already added ones
